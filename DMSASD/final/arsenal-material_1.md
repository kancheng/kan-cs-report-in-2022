Deep learning has been successfully applied to solvevarious complex problems ranging from big data analytics tocomputer vision and human-level control. 

Deep learning advanceshowever have also been employed to create software that cancause threats to privacy, democracy and national security. 

Oneof those deep learning-powered applications recently emergedis “deepfake”. 

Deepfake algorithms can create fake images andvideos that humans cannot distinguish them from authenticones.

The proposal of technologies that can automatically detectand assess the integrity of digital visual media is thereforeindispensable.

This paper presents a survey of algorithms usedto create deepfakes and, more importantly, methods proposed todetect deepfakes in the literature to date.

We present extensivediscussions on challenges, research trends and directions relatedto deepfake technologies.

By reviewing the background of deep-fakes and state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods, this studyprovides a comprehensive overview of deepfake techniques andfacilitates the development of new and more robust methods todeal with the increasingly challenging deepfakes.

深度學習已成功應用於解決從大數據分析到計算機視覺和人類水平控制的各種複雜問題，其技術也可能會被用於創造出可能對隱私、民主體制和國家安全造成威脅的軟體應用。 而近來出現的基於深度學習的應用程序則是 “deepfake”，其演算法可以做出人類用肉眼無法將它們與真品區分開來的假影像和影片。因此，擁有能夠自動檢測和評估數位視覺媒體完整性等技術的提議是必不可少的。本研究介紹了用於創造深度偽造的演算法的調查，更重要的是，介紹了迄今為止文獻中提出的用於檢測深度偽造的方法。同時對與深度偽造技術相關的挑戰、研究趨勢和方向進行了廣泛的討論。通過回顧深造假的背景和最先進的深造假檢測方法，本研究提供了深造假技術的全面概述，並有助於開發新的、更強大的方法來應對日益具有挑戰性的深度偽造局面。
