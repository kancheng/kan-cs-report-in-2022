0. The Creation and Detection of Deepfakes: A Survey

https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11138


```
Generative deep learning algorithms have progressed to a point where it is difficult to tell the difference between what is real and what is fake. 

In 2018, it was discovered how easy it is to use this technology for unethical and malicious applications, such as the spread of misinformation, impersonation of political leaders, and the defamation of innocent individuals. Since then, these 'deepfakes' have advanced significantly.

In this paper, we explore the creation and detection of deepfakes and provide an in-depth view of how these architectures work.

The purpose of this survey is to provide the reader with a deeper understanding of (1) how deepfakes are created and detected, (2) the current trends and advancements in this domain, (3) the shortcomings of the current defense solutions, and (4) the areas which require further research and attention.

目前生成式深度學習算法已經發展到難以區分真假的程度，而自 2018 年起，人們發現將這項技術用於不道德和惡意應用是多麼容易，例如傳播錯誤信息、冒充政治領導人以及誹謗無辜個人。 從那時起，這些“深度偽造”取得了顯著進展。該研究探討了 deepfakes 的創建和檢測，並深入了解這些架構的工作原理。本次調查的目的是讓讀者更深入地了解（1）如何創建和檢測深度偽造，（2）該領域的當前趨勢和進步，（3）當前防禦解決方案的缺點，以及（ 4）需要進一步研究和關注的領域。
